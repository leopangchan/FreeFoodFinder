As a student living on a limited budget, I want to receive notifications of free food on campus so that I can take advantage of opportunities.

As someone who likes to try new foods, I want to find places and times where free food is offered so that I can sample new foods without having to do independent research.

As a leader of a on-campus organization, I want to send out information about events involving free food so that I can publicize my event and attract a new audience.
