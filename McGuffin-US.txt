As a student, I want to know the locations and times of events with free food on campus, so I can attend those events and eat there.


As a club officer, I want to advertise my club using free food as a motivator, so that more people are incited to attend my club meeting.


As an event manager, I want to know how many people plan to attend my event, so that I can adjust the amount of food I provide.
